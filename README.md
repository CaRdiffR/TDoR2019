# Hackathon for the Transgender Day of Remembrance 2019

The Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR), observed annually on 20 November, memorializes those who were killed or lost to suicide as a result of anti-transgender hatred or prejudice in the past year. In 2018, Cardiff R User Group hosted a datathon centred on the data collected by monitoring bodies and trans activists about relevant deaths, as collated for recent years on https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/. This resulted in a R data package: https://github.com/cardiffR/tdor.

As a pre-event for [Cardiff satRday](https://cardiff2019.satrdays.org/) we will be hosting another hackathon with two main objectives:
 - Explore the data for 2019: help with data cleaning as well as story-telling via visualisations, dashboards, etc.
 - Update the *tdor* package with the 2019 data and add functionality to work with the new API for https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/.

The hackathon is on Friday 15 November, 1:00pam to 6:00pm, where we will welcome the maintainer of https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/ as an invited participant, see further details on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/265508847/).

The datathon is supported by Forwards (https://forwards.github.io/) and Rainbow R (https://rlgbtq.github.io/).

We have two guides for getting started (Work in Progress!):

[Data Explorer](getting_started_data_explorer.md)  
[Package Contributor](package_contributor.md)

Choose the path that suits your interest! In both cases you can use the R Studio cloud instance, which is already set up with the latest version of the data, the *tdor* package and all its dependencies and other useful packages for data exploration and package development. If you don't already have one, we recommend you sign up for a GitHub account - see the advice on choosing a username in the great [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html). Use of git is required for package contribution, but you can always team up with others if you want to contribute but aren't familiar with git.
