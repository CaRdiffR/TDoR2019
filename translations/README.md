## Keywords

The file `keywords.csv` contains a set of keywords that we aim to translate to different languages, to help search for cases to add to the TDoR dataset.

### Contributing keyword translations

We welcome keyword translations from people who are fluent in the target languages. Please do not submit a machine translation, a dictionary translation or a translation for a language you are not fluent in, as we are aiming for high quality translations that reflect the equivalent words that would be used in practice (in online media, social media, etc).

View [`keywords.csv`](https://github.com/CaRdiffR/TDoR2019/blob/master/translations/keywords.csv) on Github to check if the languages you are fluent in have been covered (if you click on `keywords.csv` above, you can view the file as an HTML table). If you can contribute a missing translation, please follow the instructions below. If you want to contribute a translation for a language that is not listed, please raise this on the issue page: https://github.com/CaRdiffR/TDoR2019/issues/1.

**If you're not familiar with GitHub**  
 
1. Go to [`keywords.csv`](https://github.com/CaRdiffR/TDoR2019/blob/master/translations/keywords.csv) and right click on the `Raw` button. Choose "Save link as" and save as "keywords.csv" (you may have to change the file extension).

2. Open `keywords.csv` and add your translation to the relevant column. Double-check you are in the right column and your translation matches the English word/phrase on the same row in the first column. Save your changes.

3. Go to the [`translations`]https://github.com/CaRdiffR/TDoR2019/tree/master/translations directory, select the `Upload files` files and upload your modified `keywords.csv`. 

4. Add a commit message in the dialog box under "Commit changes". Select the second radio button "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" and click `Propose changes`. On the page that opens click `Create pull request`. One of the team will review your changes.

**If you have a GitHub account and know how to clone a GitHub repository**  

1. Fork a copy of rlgbtq/TDoR2018 to your own GitHub account, by clicking on the `Fork` button in the top-right corner of this page.

2. Clone the forked repo on your account to your local computer. As this repo is a simple data repo at present, 
there is no need to create a branch to make your changes, you can work on the master branch.

3. Open `keywords.csv` and add your translation to the relevant column. Double-check you are in the right column and your translation matches the English word/phrase on the same row in the first column. Save your changes.

4. Ideally make one commit for all keywords of one target language.

5. Push the changes to GitHub.

6. On GitHub, go to the forked repo. Click `New pull request`. GitHub will show the changes you have made. Check everything looks right, edit the message if necessary, then click `Create pull request`. One of the team will review your pull request and before merging it in.
